## Session Log

### Session 1: 2025-10-20 Evening - Project Initialization
**Time:** 20:14-21:13 (59 minutes)
**Focus:** Claude Code Educator setup, FastAPI basics, multi-agent research
**Completed:** 
- Created atlas-project directory structure
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic, OpenAI Agents SDK, Supabase)
- Configured .clauderc with strict Educator instructions (v2 - teaching-first)
- Created app/main.py with FastAPI app and health endpoint
- Initialized git repository
- First commit: project structure
- Validated educator teaching cycle (explain → show → implement → review)

**Learned:** 
- FastAPI request lifecycle (Browser → Uvicorn → Starlette → FastAPI → Function)
- What endpoints are (URL paths mapped to functions)
- Decorators in Python (@app.get pattern)
- Async/await purpose (non-blocking I/O for concurrent requests)
- CORS middleware (enables frontend-backend communication)
- Type hints for automatic validation
- Pydantic models for data validation
- ASGI architecture layers

**Understanding Level:**
- FastAPI basics: 4/10 (understand concepts, need practice)
- Async Python: 3/10 (conceptual understanding, no hands-on yet)
- Git workflow: 5/10 (comfortable with basics)
- Project structure: 6/10 (understand organization pattern)

**Challenges:**
- Pydantic version conflict (resolved with >= instead of ==)
- Initial educator showed too much code (fixed with stricter instructions)

**Wins:**
- First FastAPI app running successfully
- Educator mode validated and working
- Clean git history started
- Strong conceptual foundation before coding

**Next:**
- Session 2 (Tomorrow 16:00): Database integration with Supabase
- Module 1.2: Connection setup, schema creation, basic queries
- Continue incremental learning approach

### Session 2: 2025-10-20 Evening - FastAPI Deep Dive
**Time:** Evening session (continued)
**Focus:** Understanding FastAPI internals, architecture decisions, and deployment basics
**Completed:**
- ✅ Learned detailed FastAPI project structure for multi-agent systems
- ✅ Understood separation of concerns (API → Services → Models)
- ✅ Deep dive into FastAPI vs Next.js architecture decision
- ✅ Learned FastAPI request/response internals
- ✅ Understood ASGI architecture (Uvicorn → Starlette → FastAPI)
- ✅ Explored async/await and non-blocking I/O concepts
- ✅ Cleaned up main.py to minimal 25-line structure
- ✅ Configured CORS middleware properly
- ✅ Debugged port conflicts (learned lsof, kill commands)
- ✅ Resolved localhost vs 127.0.0.1 networking issue
- ✅ Server running successfully on port 8000 with --host 0.0.0.0
- ✅ Tested health check and root endpoints
- ✅ Accessed auto-generated docs at /docs and /redoc

**Concepts Learned:**
1. **FastAPI Project Structure for Multi-Agent Systems:**
   - `/app` - Main application directory
   - `/app/main.py` - Entry point (app creation, middleware, lifecycle)
   - `/app/api/v1/endpoints/` - Thin endpoint handlers (validation only)
   - `/app/services/` - Business logic (agent coordination, task delegation)
   - `/app/agents/` - Agent implementations (researcher, coder, planner)
   - `/app/models/` - Database models (SQLAlchemy)
   - `/app/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas (API contracts)
   - `/app/core/` - Configuration, security, dependencies
   - `/app/db/` - Database session management
   - `/app/utils/` - Shared utilities

2. **Why FastAPI + Next.js Architecture:**
   - Next.js = Frontend layer (React, SSR, routing, UI components)
   - FastAPI = Backend/AI layer (Python AI/ML ecosystem)
   - Separation enables independent scaling and deployment
   - Python has superior AI library support (OpenAI SDK, LangChain, etc.)
   - Next.js API routes are for simple requests, not complex AI orchestration
   - Backend can serve multiple clients (web, mobile, CLI)

3. **FastAPI Under the Hood:**
   - Request flow: Browser → Uvicorn (ASGI) → Starlette → FastAPI → Your code
   - Route registration: Decorators store URL→function mappings
   - Auto-validation: Type hints trigger Pydantic validation
   - Response serialization: Python dicts → JSON automatically
   - OpenAPI schema generation: Powers /docs and /redoc

4. **Async Programming Deep Dive:**
   - `async def` enables non-blocking I/O operations
   - Critical for multi-agent systems with concurrent LLM calls
   - Without async: 100 users wait in sequential queue
   - With async: Python switches between waiting requests
   - Essential for APOLLO (multiple agents, LLM calls, databases)

5. **Network Debugging:**
   - `localhost` = hostname (needs DNS resolution)
   - `127.0.0.1` = IPv4 loopback address (direct)
   - `0.0.0.0` = Listen on all network interfaces
   - Port conflicts: `lsof -ti :8000 | xargs kill -9`
   - Uvicorn binding: `--host 0.0.0.0` makes both localhost and 127.0.0.1 work

**Code Written:**
- `app/main.py` - Minimal FastAPI structure (imports, app creation, CORS, 2 endpoints)

**Tools & Commands Mastered:**
- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` - Start server
- `lsof -i :8000` - Find process using port
- `lsof -ti :8000 | xargs kill -9` - Kill port one-liner
- `pkill -f uvicorn` - Kill all uvicorn processes
- Auto-generated docs: `/docs` (Swagger UI), `/redoc` (ReDoc)

**Understanding Level:**
- FastAPI architecture: 6/10 (solid conceptual understanding)
- Async Python: 4/10 (understand why, need practice with implementation)
- ASGI stack: 5/10 (understand layers and flow)
- Network debugging: 7/10 (can troubleshoot port/host issues)
- Project structure patterns: 7/10 (know where things belong)

**Key Insights:**
- FastAPI is a translator between HTTP and Python
- Type hints = automatic validation (no manual code needed)
- Decorator pattern wraps functions with FastAPI logic
- CORS is essential for frontend-backend communication
- `0.0.0.0` binding solves localhost vs IP issues

**Next Session:**
- Create full project directory structure (api/, services/, models/, agents/)
- Set up environment configuration (core/config.py)
- Learn database integration options
- Plan first agent implementation
