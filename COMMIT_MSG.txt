fix(milestone): resolve milestone creation and streaming issues

Major fixes:
- Fixed milestone creation bug where agent claimed success but didn't execute tools
- Added conversation persistence to /chat/stream endpoint
- Enhanced error handling for OpenAI rate limits
- Added streaming character-by-character for better UX
- Fixed missing CORSMiddleware and OAuth2PasswordRequestForm imports

Architecture improvements:
- /chat/stream now handles full lifecycle: save user msg → execute AI + tools → save AI response
- Frontend uses /chat/stream with conversation_id instead of manual message saves
- Added comprehensive logging ([ROUTING], [AGENT RESPONSE], [MILESTONE DEBUG])
- Limited conversation history to 10 messages to prevent token overflow

Cleanup:
- Removed all test files (test_agent.py, test_context.py, tests/ directory)
- Removed test files from agents/tools/ directory
- Removed test_timeline.py from routes/
- Cleaned up test data from database

Frontend enhancements:
- Added 30-second timeout for hanging streams
- Improved error messages with actionable guidance
- Added progress event handling
- Auto-reload conversation after AI response

Technical details:
- Backend: 7 files modified, 8 test files deleted
- Frontend: 1 file modified (chat/page.tsx)
- Net: -977 lines (removed cruft, added production code)
- Tool calling now fully operational for tasks, goals, and milestones
