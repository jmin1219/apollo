## Concepts Mastered ✅

### Module 1: Backend Foundation

**FastAPI & REST APIs**
- ✅ Application creation and configuration (FastAPI app, middleware)
- ✅ Route definition with path and query parameters

- ✅ HTTP status codes (201 Created, 204 No Content, 400/401/404/500 errors)
- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Error handling with HTTPException and chaining (`from e`)
- ✅ Pydantic models for request/response validation
- ✅ Type hints and Optional fields

**Database & PostgreSQL**
- ✅ Relational database design (users, tasks tables)
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletion
- ✅ UUID primary keys (vs auto-increment trade-offs)
- ✅ Supabase client integration
- ✅ SQL query patterns (select, insert, update, delete with filters)
- ✅ Database transactions and error handling
- ✅ TIMESTAMPTZ for timezone-aware timestamps

**Authentication & Security**
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (never compare hashes directly!)
- ✅ `verify_password()` pattern for secure comparison
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ OAuth2PasswordRequestForm (username field for email)
- ✅ Bearer token authentication
- ✅ Protected endpoint patterns with `Depends(get_current_user)`
- ✅ User isolation (filtering by user_id)
- ✅ Security best practices (environment variables, status code consistency)

**Python Patterns**
- ✅ Async/await for I/O-bound operations
- ✅ Type casting with `cast()`
- ✅ Pydantic v2 `@field_validator` for custom validation
- ✅ Python error handling (try/except/finally, exception chaining)
- ✅ Dependency injection pattern (FastAPI Depends)

### Module 1: Frontend Foundation

**React & Next.js**
- ✅ Next.js 15 App Router (file-based routing)
- ✅ React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRouter`
- ✅ Client components (`'use client'`)
- ✅ Form handling with controlled inputs
- ✅ Event handlers (`onChange`, `onSubmit`)
- ✅ Conditional rendering and loading states
- ✅ Error state management and display

**TypeScript**
- ✅ Interface definitions for API types
- ✅ Type safety with function parameters
- ✅ Async function typing (`Promise<Type>`)
- ✅ Generic types (e.g., `apiFetch<T>`)

**API Integration**
- ✅ Fetch API with async/await
- ✅ HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- ✅ Request headers (Authorization, Content-Type)
- ✅ FormData vs JSON body
- ✅ OAuth2 form-encoded requests
- ✅ Error handling with status code checks
- ✅ JWT token storage in localStorage
- ✅ API wrapper pattern (apiFetch with auth injection)

**UI/UX**
- ✅ shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ Tailwind CSS utility classes
- ✅ Form validation (client-side checks)
- ✅ Navigation links (Next.js Link component)
- ✅ Responsive design basics

## Learning Preferences & Approach

**Style:**
- Deep dive over surface-level tutorials
- Interview-preparation depth for all concepts
- Problem-first learning (feel the pain → appreciate solution)
- Manual implementation (60% coding / 40% AI guidance)
- Understanding trade-offs and alternatives, not just "how"

**Strengths:**
- Motor learning & control research background (systematic thinking)
- Comfortable with conceptual frameworks
- Values evidence-based approaches
- Patient with complexity

**Pace:**
- 2-3 hour focused sessions
- 4-7 PM peak productivity window
- One module every 1-2 weeks
- Quality over speed

## Interview Readiness Assessment

### Can Explain in Interview:

**System Design:**
- ✅ REST API design patterns and status codes
- ✅ JWT vs session-based authentication (trade-offs)
- ✅ UUID vs auto-increment for primary keys
- ✅ Foreign key relationships and CASCADE deletion
- ✅ CORS and why it exists
- ✅ Client-server architecture (Next.js + FastAPI)

**Technical Depth:**
- ✅ Password hashing (why bcrypt, why verify() not direct comparison)
- ✅ OAuth2 Password Flow
- ✅ Bearer token authentication
- ✅ React component lifecycle and hooks
- ✅ TypeScript type safety benefits
- ✅ Async/await execution model

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Error handling strategies
- ✅ Type safety with Pydantic and TypeScript
- ✅ API wrapper pattern for DRY code
- ✅ Environment variable management

### Needs More Practice:

- 🔄 Whiteboarding database schema design
- 🔄 Explaining time/space complexity
- 🔄 Discussing scalability trade-offs
- 🔄 Testing strategies (not yet implemented)

## Notes for Educator Agent

**Assume Jaymin knows:**
- All Module 1 concepts above (don't re-teach)
- Can reference existing code patterns
- Understands async programming model
- Comfortable with REST and React fundamentals

**Build on this foundation:**
- Connect new concepts to existing knowledge
- Use Module 1 code as examples
- Progressive complexity (foundation → advanced)

**Verify through questions:**
- Even for "mastered" concepts, ask to explain in own words
- Check understanding of trade-offs, not just syntax
- Interview-style questions to assess depth

**Teaching approach:**
- Start fresh each module (diagnostic questions first)
- Adjust depth based on responses
- Don't assume perfect retention from Module 1
- Scaffold from known → unknown
